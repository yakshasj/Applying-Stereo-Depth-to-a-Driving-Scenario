# Applying-Stereo-Depth-to-a-Driving-Scenario

Now that we've reviewed the algorithms behind stereo vision and cross correlation we can begin to tackle real-world examples (Actually, we'll use images from the Carla simulator, so I suppose real-world-like would be more appropriate). .

# Instructions:
We will be using Python 3.
Avoided using for-loops and while-loops, unless we are explicitly required to do so.

# After this we will:
Be able to use OpenCV to complete standard vision tasks.
Understand the process of obtaining depth from a pair of stereo images and their respective projection matrices.
Understand the advantages of cross-correlation for localization of important information in an image.
